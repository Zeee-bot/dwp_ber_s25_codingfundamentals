# Lesson 3
# Operators, Conditions and Loops

# 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations

# Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints the results of:

# - Addition
# - Subtraction
# - Multiplication
# - Division

# a = 1
# b = 2

# print (a+b)
# print (a-b)
# print (a*b)
# print (a/b)

## Bonus!

# If you'd like to try get a bit more fancy, use the `input()` function to get '
# 'the user to manually add the two values instead of assigning them to the variables '
# 'in your code. Find out more about the `input()` function by '
# 'clicking [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp).


# i = input('enter a value:')
# j = input('enter another value:')
# print ('the sum of the two values is', int(i)+int(j))

# 2. Modulus and Exponentiation

# Write a Python program that takes a number and prints:

# - The remainder when divided by 3 (using the modulus operator %)
# - The number raised to the power of 2 (using the exponentiation operator \*\*)

# a = 10%3 
# print (a)

a = 10**2
print (a)


## Bonus!

# If you'd like to try get a bit more fancy, use the `input()`'
# ' function to get the user to manually add the two values instead'
# ' of assigning them to the variables in your code.

# i = input("enter a value:")
# j = input("enter another value:")
# print ("The remainder of the division of the two values you have entered is", int(i) % int(j))
